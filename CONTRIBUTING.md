We welcome contributions from the community! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-feature-branch`.
5. Submit a pull request.

Please ensure your code follows our [coding standards](link-to-coding-standards) and [contribution guidelines](link-to-contribution-guidelines).

### Basic guidelines

All packages you commit or submit by pull-request should follow these simple guidelines:

* Package a version which is still maintained by the upstream author and will be updated regularly with supported versions.
* Have no dependencies outside the OpenWrt core packages or this repository feed.
* Have been tested to compile with the correct includes and dependencies. Please also test with "Compile with full language support" found under "General Build Settings" set if language support is relevant to your package.
* Best of all -- it works as expected!
